"""
[NEW-04] Resumable run orchestration.

Colab sessions die. Long PQC runs die with them. This module makes a grid
restartable: every finished run drops a manifest, and re-running the grid skips
what is already on disk. Episode CSVs are written by upstream with a flush per
episode, so even an interrupted run leaves a usable partial learning curve.

Convention: results live OUTSIDE the repository (Drive, or ./results locally).
Code is versioned in git; run artefacts are not. Only the small summary tables
in docs/RESULTS-LOG.md get committed.

# Cooperative claiming, for running the same grid from several Colab sessions.
#
# The alternative is partitioning by hand - one session per seed range - which
# works and needs no code. This exists because with cells that run for hours,
# hand-partitioning means deciding the split up front and living with it: if one
# session dies at 3am its slice simply does not get done, and if one slice turns
# out cheaper that session sits idle.
#
# Best-effort, and honestly so. Google Drive's FUSE mount gives no atomic
# create, so two sessions starting the same cell within the sync window can both
# claim it. The failure mode is duplicated compute, never a corrupted result:
# both write the same manifest for the same spec. With multi-hour cells the
# window is a rounding error.
#
# Stale locks are reclaimed after `ttl_hours` - a disconnected session must not
# reserve a cell forever.
