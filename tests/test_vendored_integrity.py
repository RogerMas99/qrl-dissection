"""The vendored SimplyQRL must stay byte-identical to upstream b534cc9.

This test exists because the rule was broken within minutes of being written. A
bulk rename of `core/envs.py` -> `core/obs_adapters.py` matched
`from .envs import make_vec_env` inside `src/simplyqrl/dqn.py` and `ppo.py` and
rewrote the vendored library. Nothing failed loudly: the installed copy shadowed
the vendored one, so the whole suite still passed.

That is precisely the failure mode this repository exists to prevent. The value
of vendoring is the claim "this is upstream, unmodified, and every correction is
visible separately in `qrl_dissection/`". An unnoticed edit turns that claim into
a lie, and every correction documented in `docs/CORRECTIONS.md` becomes
unverifiable, because the reader can no longer tell what upstream did from what
we did to it.

The checksums below are of the pristine `b534cc9` tree. If one fails, either the
vendored copy was edited - revert it - or the pin moved, in which case every
correction needs re-verifying against the new revision and these hashes updated
deliberately, in their own commit.
