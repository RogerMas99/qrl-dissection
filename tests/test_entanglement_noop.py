"""FIX-07: the `ent` flag cannot affect a `skolik` circuit at n_layers_q = 1.

Why this needs a test rather than a paragraph
---------------------------------------------
`build_skolik_qlayer` closes each layer with a circular ring of CZ gates, and the
circuit is measured in the PauliZ basis. CZ is diagonal, and diagonal unitaries
commute with Z, so the entangling block of the FINAL layer can never change
`<Z_i>`. At depth 1 that is the only entangling block, and the flag is a complete
no-op; at depth L only L-1 blocks do anything.

Two consequences the repo depends on:

  * The paper's `Skolik_DR_L1_Entangled` vs `Skolik_DR_L1_Unentangled` contrast
    compares a circuit against itself, which is why their logged returns are
    identical on all 10 seeds. That is an experimental-design artefact, NOT
    duplicated data - and this test is the evidence for the distinction.

  * exp03 sweeps DR depth on the Skolik template with `ent=True`, so its depth
    axis is confounded with effective entanglement depth (0, 1 and 4 blocks at
    L = 1, 2, 5). See docs/RESULTS-LOG.md, Experiment 03.

The Hsiao template is unaffected - its ablation is valid at every depth - so the
test also pins that contrast, to keep the claim precise rather than sweeping.
