"""Weight saving (docs/ROADMAP.md's NEW-06 follow-up dependency, docs/REUSE.md
"model weights are now saved, narrowly").

`SafeDQN.train()` writes the ONLINE network's `state_dict()` once, after
training finishes - no optimiser state, no replay buffer, no
exploration-schedule position, no RNG streams. This is inference support
(e.g. extracting a trained circuit's Fourier spectrum), explicitly NOT
resumption support - `docs/REUSE.md` point 3 ("Mid-run continuation - no, and
deliberately not") is unaffected and untested here on purpose, because
nothing about it changed.

The compatibility guard that matters most: `TrainOutcome.extra` already
defaulted to `{}` before this change, so a manifest written before this
change simply lacks the `weights_path` key - no schema migration, and this is
pinned below by loading a manifest shaped like the pre-change ones.
